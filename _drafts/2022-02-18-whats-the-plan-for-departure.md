# What's the Plan for Departure?

## Goodbye, Berkeley. Hello, World!

The Coconut Milk Run ‚Äî The "Long" Way 'Round.

![Route Plan](/assets/images/whats-the-plan/world-map-route.svg)

## `whoami`

Call me Shane.

### What Started All of This?

I had this idea to sail around the world in 2009 while sitting in my dorm room in Montgomery, Alabama during my second year in the United States Air Force. I didn't even know what it meant when I wrote it down, but it felt like something that had to be done. It remained scribbled in some long-lost and forgotten notebook, never to be seen again.

Years later, around 2015, while I was finishing my Master's of Science in Game Design in Florida, I was learning to code at a hackerspace in Longwood. During a late-night jam session, attempting to make an algorithmic music generation app, I was heading to Wawa with another hacker at the space. We got in his car to go get a sub and I asked where he lived ‚Äî¬†"New Smyrna Beach, on my boat." That got my attention; it was the first time I had ever heard of someone even adjacent to that lifestyle.

Now that I knew it was achievable, the old idea came back into my head ‚Äî "Sail Around the World." Does someone just buy a boat they see on the side of the road? What's involved in the selection process? A lot, it turns out.

### Why _This_ Route?

There seems to be a lot of people that are perfectly happy in higher (or lower in the Southern Hemisphere) latitudes, but not me. I'd much prefer a warm climate, where a quick dip in the ocean would cool me off, but doesn't cause me to freeze while I surf for an entire day without a wetsuit.

#### Comfort vs Speed

There are day-sailors, racers, and cruisers. Each type of boat has an appropriate match in a sailor archetype.

#### Cost Now vs Cost Later

> There's nothing more expensive than a cheap boat.

#### Looks Aren't Everything

But they are a big chunk of it.

## What Does Adventure Mean to You?

So many people say they're "always down for adventure." A two-hour hike or rock climbing in a gym doesn't count, despite what the vernacular seems to be trending towards. Without an element of risk, the notion is empty. Failure, while not an option, must still a possibility.

At the time of publishing, since January of 2021, I have sought out and met 72 women in-person (that I can remember) for the purpose of finding someone to accompany me on this journey. While so many of them are incredible people, most merely have the ambition to lead what can only be considered a "comfortable" life. If they're happy with that, fair enough, but I've been looking for something less common.

## The Seven Sages of O Dock

There's wisdom all around. You've just gotta look for it and be ready to hear it when it comes. Usually it comes from the bearded men on the dock with a cart in-tow.

> First it's Christmas, then New Year's, then Valentine's Day, then you're sixty-three years old like me, and you haven't left the dock.

-Paul

> You'll see when you get out there ‚Äî¬†Nobody else has any equipment or experience. You're over-prepared.

-Paul K

> The hardest part about sailing around the world is leaving the dock.

-Steve

> You look ready to go. Why are you _here_?

-Brian

## Why?

There's been something drawing me out West since before I can remember. I like to think it's related to my namesake, [Shane](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_(film)>). At the end of March, I'll ride into the sunset on my fiberglass horse and I'll let the audience decide whether I made it or not.

## The Journey is the Destination

The destination is the journey.

It's just **time** to go.

## Departure

The Golden Gate (to the rest of the Earth). We'll depart to the West, then turn left and head down the coast, running towards Ventura.

![Departure to Ventura](/assets/images/whats-the-plan/world-map-route-march-pilot.svg)

According to pilot charts for March (and April lines up nicely in the same fashion), there are only likely two days of the month without any wind, with overwhelmingly-likely Force 4 to 6 winds from the North/Northwest and a following current of 0.7 knots. These sound like pretty ideal conditions for a first passage.

### Who's Going on the First Leg?

#### Valeriya

After buying her own boat in New York, she made a trip down to Florida along the East Coast of the United States. She has since sailed in many races in the San Francisco Bay and cruised in the Canary Islands, Cuba, and Mexico.

#### Dustin

Dustin has been a liveaboard sailor for nearly ten years in Florida. One day, he will embark on Project Freedom, heading to the Galapagos through the Panama Canal and the Caribbean thereafter.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will you be alone?

I'm anticipating being alone for the majority of the time. There's a common misconception that most of the time will be spent on a passage. Much of the time will be spent at anchor or in a marina.

### How Does it Feel?

I don't feel good or bad about it. It's just what's going to happen. I have to do this trip and it's not even my choice. There's been some invisible force driving my actions to get to this point and it's simply time for it to occur.

### Do you have an Instagram?

No. üñïüèº

### Will you work?

[I have Internet]({% post_url 2021-02-02-wireless-networking %}) and a remote job, at least at the time of writing.

### Isn't it dangerous?

[Probably](https://www.yachtingworld.com/blogs/elaine-bunting/how-dangerous-is-sailing-round-the-world-6448).
